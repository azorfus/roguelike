This is a roguelike i created on 30/12/2020

The game only works on linux.

If your terminal does not support color you can say no to the color option.

run 'make' in the same directory as all the other files and run ./rogue
(or)
do "sudo ./install.sh" to install the game into the system. If you install it, you can run "arpg" anywhere to start the game!
